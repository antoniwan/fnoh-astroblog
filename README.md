## 🎨 CSS Architecture

This project features a **modern, well-structured CSS architecture** that follows 2025 best practices:

- **Foundation CSS**: Reset, variables, typography, utilities, and print styles
- **Component Scoping**: Astro's built-in CSS scoping for component-specific styles
- **Design System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Accessibility First**: Reduced motion support, focus management, and semantic markup
- **Performance**: Modern CSS features like `clamp()`, `calc()`, and logical properties

See [`src/styles/README.md`](src/styles/README.md) for detailed CSS architecture documentation.
