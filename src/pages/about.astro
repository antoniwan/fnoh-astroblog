		<strong>Field Notes on Humanity</strong> is a space for thoughtful inquiry into what it means 
		to be human in our rapidly evolving world. This project emerged from a simple observation: that 
		the journey of human becoming is ongoing, complex, and deeply personal—yet also universally shared.
	</p>

	<p>
		Like field notes from an anthropologist or naturalist, each post here captures a moment of 
		observation, reflection, or insight. These notes explore the intersections of personal growth, 
		human nature, relationships, meaning-making, and the challenges of navigating modern life. They're 
		not meant to be definitive answers, but rather thoughtful questions and shared experiences that 
		might resonate with others on similar paths.
	</p>

	<p>
		The title "Field Notes on Humanity" reflects several ideas: First, that we are all in 
		process—constantly becoming, growing, and changing. Second, that this becoming happens in the 
		"field" of our daily lives, relationships, and experiences. And third, that taking notes—paying 
		attention, reflecting, and sharing—is a valuable part of the journey.
	</p>

	<p>
		This space welcomes anyone interested in thoughtful reflection on the human condition. Whether 
		you're seeking understanding, connection, or simply a moment to pause and consider, you're welcome 
		here. The posts range from personal reflections to broader observations about human nature, always 
		aiming for authenticity, curiosity, and gentle wisdom.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thank you for joining this exploration. May these notes serve as companions on your own journey 
		of becoming human.
