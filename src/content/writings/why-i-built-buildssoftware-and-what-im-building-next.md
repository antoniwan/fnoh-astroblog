Welcome to <a href="https://builds.software" target="_blank">**builds.software**</a> — the digital forge of Antonio Rodriguez Martinez. _I just released `v2+` of my personal website and I’m stoked!_ This is not just a personal site. It’s a terminal window into a life of **experimentation, resilience, design, and code.** Every pixel, repo, and line of text reflects years of hard-earned lessons —  from startups to breakdowns, from poetry to product launches.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find

- **Writing** — Technical insights, philosophical explorations, and legacy documentation
- **Projects** — Software, hardware, and human systems built with care and curiosity
- **The Stack** — A living record of the tools and technologies I trust
- **Principles** — A public ledger of what I stand for, and why

## 🔍 Who I Am

- 🐺 Warrior(lol) of many roles: TPM, coder, mentor, dad, poet, craftsman
- 🪵 Builder of legacy projects like **Strong Hands, Soft Heart**
- 🛠️ Fixer of broken things — technical, emotional, and systemic

## 🌀 Why This Site Exists

Because social platforms aren’t enough. Because algorithms don’t deserve my best work. Because I needed one place to **build in public**, on my own terms.
