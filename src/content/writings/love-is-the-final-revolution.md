title: Love Is the Final Revolution
description: >-
  After nearly losing myself to global chaos, I found the most radical act isn't outrage — it's love. A reflection on politics, fear, and why building a home rooted in kindness may be the ultimate rebellion.

For weeks, I've been drowning in the world's problems — and almost forgot to love my own life. My thoughts, writings, and ramblings have been almost entirely consumed by problems—both microscopic and massive. From dissecting my own self-sabotaging tendencies and the constant work of staying open to feedback, to learning about the ongoing civil war in Sudan, the reality that Israel has universal healthcare- and we don't..., the Gaza crisis, and the tangled mess that our own government officials describe and prescribe… somewhere in that constant stream of madness, I got lost in the sauce.

I almost lost myself—lost the version of me I'd worked so hard to rebuild. I drifted from focusing on my values, on all the kindness in the world, and began living in an on/off state of anger, fear, and worry. My brain spent entire days agonizing over things completely beyond my control. My girlfriend would kiss me and say, "You were gone." My 5-year-old would call out, "Papá, papáaaa, PAPÁ! ¿Dónde estabas?" And I would answer, "Disculpa, estaba en mi mente." Thank the Universe I'm in a receptive era, because my girls noticed—and they called me back.

I could even see the change in my own writing data. Since stopping my self-help routines, spiritual guidance practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy assignments in favor of "studying and learning more about real life," I'd turned my attention toward the cruelty of capitalism — the way it quietly bleeds the most vulnerable dry. One day I read about a single mother who had her credit card limit lowered without warning, leaving her unable to pay for groceries. It hit me hard because I'd been there. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, every bank I dealt with clipped my credit limits down to exactly what I had spent — overnight. AMEX sent me a letter "in good faith" offering me the _chance_ to pay off nearly $10,000 immediately to avoid further restrictions. As I dug into the story, I found I wasn't alone — millions were going through the same thing at the exact same moment. That was when I started digging into the dual economies: the one we live in, and the parallel one of insider trading and closed-door deals. My curiosity led me deep into U.S. politics, tracing our mess back to its roots. But I barely scratched the surface, and the bias in every source I read made me doubt it all.

In simple terms, it wrecked me.

And yet, after tumbling down that rabbit hole, I can say with confidence: the thing that saved me was **love**. Self-love. Love for my family and friends. Redirecting my energy, focus, mind, and body into the people and moments I can actually touch with my five senses. That's what pulled me out of the black hole of despair.

It took real shadow work to realize that presence, rooted in love and kindness, is the only sustainable way to face the cruelty of our human systems. My daughter's laughter, my girlfriend's affection, my ex-wife's empathy, nourishing my body and mind, and creating a home where kindness is our default — that is what I _can_ do. Love is, ultimately, the most revolutionary force we have.

> **Love is, ultimately, the most revolutionary force we have.**

As a parent, I believe raising my children with kindness, empathy, restraint, self-care, and self-respect is the most meaningful revolutionary act available to me. To move through life from a place of love is to resist every system that seeks to dehumanize.

When I think back on those weeks when I felt like I couldn't breathe, I see now that I was missing love — and the safety it brings. Our governments and systems remind us daily that we are expendable, just fuel for war machines and profit engines. **But at home, we can create a sanctuary that defies that message.**

By living and modeling love, abundance, respect, and compassion — by truly listening to one another — we enact the most radical form of resistance. We teach our children justice, fairness, and care. We live out the real commandment of Christ: _Ama. Ama a tu prójimo._ Love. Love thy neighbor.

It reminds me of that moment in _V for Vendetta_ when Evey finally understands what V was trying to teach her — that when you are grounded in love, in your values, in your humanity, there is nothing left to take from you. Fear dissolves. Even the threat of death loses its power, because love gives life meaning beyond survival. That's why systems built on fear cannot coexist with a home or a heart rooted in love. Love makes us ungovernable in the best way — not because we reject all authority, but because we refuse to be ruled by fear.

Because love terrifies the powerful. It can't be taxed, sanctioned, or legislated away. It doesn't need permission, and it multiplies every time it's given. In a world built to keep us afraid and divided, the simple act of loving — fully, openly, without condition — is the loudest rebellion we can stage.

That's the revolution. *Love is the final revolution!*
