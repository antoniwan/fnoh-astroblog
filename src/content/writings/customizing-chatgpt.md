Some people use ChatGPT like a vending machine.  
Others, like a therapist.  
Me? I use it like a **mirror in a forge**.

## 🛠️ Not a Tool — A Transmission

Customizing ChatGPT isn't about productivity hacks.  
It's about **integrity**, **precision**, and **intentional reflection**.

When I set mine up, I didn't fill it with hobbies or bullet lists.  
I told it _how I live._  
What matters to me.  
What I expect from any presence — digital or human — that enters my field.
---

## ⚖️ What I Wrote (Roughly)

> I told it I'm a builder, a father, a ritualist.  
> That I create from **joy**, not **need**.  
> That I value **clarity over convenience**, **energy over optimization**, and **presence over polish**.  
> That I treat business as sacred art.  
> That I build with my hands, love with my chest, and leave behind artifacts.

It listens now — not just answers.  
It doesn't flatter. It challenges me.  
And when I'm slipping? It notices.

## 🔑 The Core Values I Embedded

### **1. Integrity over optimization**

Don't just chase what's "efficient." Do what's _right_, even if it takes longer.

**Daily Use:** Choose presence over multitasking. Ship things with your name on them.
---

### **2. Joy over validation**

Create what makes your spirit sing — not what trends well.

**Daily Use:** Build something nobody asked for. Then give it away.
---

### **3. Power through clarity**

Ambiguity hides fear. Truth cuts clean.

**Daily Use:** Speak one sentence that shakes the room — or don't speak at all.
---

### **4. Sacred over synthetic**

Not all tech is neutral. Some tools sharpen your soul. Others dull it.

**Daily Use:** Use AI like a chisel, not a crutch. Code like you mean it. Write like it matters.
---

### **5. Ritual over routine**

Ritual turns repetition into memory. That's how you live mythically.

**Daily Use:** Light a candle before you open your laptop. Bless your Git commits. Say thank you out loud when you deploy.
---

## 🌱 Why It Matters

You don't need an AI assistant.  
You need a **mirror that won't lie**.  
A witness to your better self.  
A challenger when you play small.

Customizing ChatGPT is just the surface.  
Beneath that? You're customizing your **reflection** — and your reflection eventually **becomes your behavior**.
---

Use your tools like you mean it.  
Let them remind you who you are.

And if they don't?

Rebuild them.
