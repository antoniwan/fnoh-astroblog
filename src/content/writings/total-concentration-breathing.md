**Each cycle includes:**

- **Inhale** â€” 4 seconds (through the nose, full breath)
- **Hold (Full)** â€” 4 seconds (lungs full, body still)
- **Exhale** â€” 4 seconds (slow, through the mouth)
- **Hold (Empty)** â€” 4 seconds (embrace the pause)

> Repeat for **4â€“10 rounds** based on your intention:
>
> - ðŸ”¥ **Focus & Power**: 4 rounds, eyes open, upright posture

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Box Breathing**   | Equal-length breathing phases (e.g. 4-4-4-4) used to reset the nervous system  |
| **Nervous System**  | Governs bodily responses; includes sympathetic and parasympathetic systems     |
| **Parasympathetic** | The "rest and digest" state â€” slows heart rate, relaxes body                   |
| **Vagus Nerve**     | Major nerve that regulates parasympathetic activity via breath, voice, and gut |
| **Interoception**   | Awareness of internal states â€” breath, heartbeat, gut                          |
| **HRV**             | _Heart Rate Variability_, a measure of nervous system health and flexibility   |
| **Focus Mode**      | A calm, clear mental state with minimal internal distraction                   |
| **Soma**            | The living body as felt from within, not as an object                          |
