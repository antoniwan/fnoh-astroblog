To be negative, I must assume negativity; to be resentful, I must bear affliction; to be hateful, I must bring hate into my life. To be petty, I must force myself to behave inconsequentially.

I am not a victim; I am a victor of my circumstances. I will check myself and only bring and dish out what I want to personify! I won’t reduce myself to any nonsense.

✨

I can not control how you feel and react; I am not responsible for you. I can only control my actions and responses and am accountable for myself. I want to be an agent of joy and kindness, true to my values, free and powerful.

Truth be told, I am exhausted with negativity and resentment, and hate is not my answer; Love and kindness are the answer. I’m letting the noise, manifested through these destructive and resentful thoughts and feelings, fade away, leaving the stress and anxiety behind them.

This clarity is the power I have.
