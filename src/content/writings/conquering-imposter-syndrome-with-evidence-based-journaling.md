Overcoming imposter syndrome is an ongoing process. I have adopted an evidence-based approach to my mental regulation work, a strategy that has proven highly effective. I invite you to explore this aspect of my journey. It’s a humble brag moment, but one that is worth sharing. Here is my latest entry/reflection:

> My freelance clients get sticker shock whenever they see my hourly rate, but see. You are not hiring just a ‘software developer’; you are hiring an absolute work machine that has worked at the intersection of digital marketing and software development for 16+ years for projects and clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small mom-and-pop shops and a wildly variable number of successful and efficient projects. Additionally, I’m upfront about used hours and only charge you for the time I spend, not more or less. Integrity and my values allow me to do that with complete transparency. I’ve built a web gaming platform for Sony PlayStation; I’ve built sweepstakes for thousands of prominent clients for millions of users; I’ve built Lexus Car configurators for their US website; I’ve built a fully-featured website for Copa Airlines that includes flight booking; I’ve also built web portfolios for individuals, and software applications that take a hard-file of university courses, and do magic to provide students their course selection user interface on the web; I also built the first “chatbot” gaming platform ever over Facebook Messenger, this thing used NLP when people were only dreaming about this. I’ve messed up sometimes, but we have always recovered through honesty and hard work. In addition to the vast project experience, the cherry on top is that I’ve worked so hard on my soft skills, communication, empathy, active listening, management, product, software engineering, and leadership that I force multiply and influence everybody around me. I’m very powerful!

Sharing is caring! I hope you can apply this type of evidence-based journaling approach to your emotional regulation to manage imposter syndrome. Remember to focus on your wins and the tangible.

If you notice you make many mistakes in your work, that’s an excellent opportunity to understand a lagoon you might want to work on intentionally. “The obstacle is the way!”

Good luck!
