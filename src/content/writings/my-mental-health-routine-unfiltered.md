I’ve spent the last 14 days rebuilding my nervous system from the ground up after completing assessing and reviewing my intelligence and medical health, bloodwork, sexual health, cholesterol, prostate, who knows, I got so many things done on myself; I even got myself a vasectomy appointment in the process. LOL

Here’s what’s keeping me mentally sharp, emotionally clean, and spiritually dangerous (in the best way):

- **Breathwork** (I call it Total Concentration Breathing 🫁)
- **Writing every single day** (not for likes, for survival)
- **Gym & stretching** (RPE + failure sets + foam rolling)
- **Art** — drawing, guitar, design. Expression _is_ medicine.
- **FaceTime with my daughter** — hours a day, pure love
- **Hard conversations** — family, friends, lovers. No hiding.
- **Real food, cooked by me** — I don’t let chaos enter my gut.
- **Sunrise mornings** — no alarm. Just rhythm.
- **Journaling** after dates, arguments, and moments of awe.
- **Walking barefoot on wet grass** — grounding. Literally.
- **Laughing with strangers** — full presence. Headphones off.
- **Resting without guilt** — 7–8 hours. No grindset BS.
- **Protecting my energy** — letting go of masked “friends.”

### 🧠💥 **Prompts for you (read this slooooooooowwwwwllllyyyyyy)**

> What’s your nervous system asking for right now? What small ritual makes you feel like yourself again? What would your 10-year-old self beg you to start doing again?

You don’t need to copy this list. Make it sacred. Make it yours. Do it with your full attention. **Let it change your life. BROOO!!!!!** (achieve an emotionally regulated nervous system)

🌱 From love. From breath. From truth. Let’s grow.
