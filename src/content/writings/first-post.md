Every journey begins with a single step, and every becoming starts with a moment of recognition. This is my first field note in what I hope will be a long series of observations, reflections, and shared experiences about what it means to be human.

The idea of "becoming human" has been on my mind lately. Not in the sense of achieving some final state of perfection, but rather in the ongoing process of growth, understanding, and connection that defines our shared humanity. We are all, in some way, works in progress—constantly evolving, learning, and adapting to the world around us.

What does it mean to take field notes on this process? For me, it's about paying attention. It's about noticing the moments when I feel most human—the times of joy, connection, struggle, and growth. It's about capturing these observations not just for myself, but to share with others who might be on similar paths.

This space will serve as a collection of these notes. Some will be deeply personal, others more observational. Some will explore specific experiences, while others might reflect on broader patterns of human behavior and interaction. The goal isn't to provide answers, but to ask thoughtful questions and share experiences that might resonate with others.

As I begin this practice of field notes, I'm reminded that the most valuable observations often come from the most ordinary moments. The way we interact with strangers, how we respond to challenges, the small acts of kindness or courage we witness—these are all part of the rich tapestry of human becoming.

I invite you to join me in this exploration. Whether you're reading these notes, sharing your own experiences, or simply reflecting on your own journey, you're part of this ongoing conversation about what it means to be human.

This is just the beginning. There will be many more notes to come, each capturing a moment, a thought, or an experience from the field of human becoming. I look forward to sharing this journey with you.
