I've been thinking about getting a tattoo‚Äîor many‚Äîbut I can't pull the trigger. There's something about having a "clean" body that feels sacred. Still, the idea of _customizing_ it, of turning my body into a living archive of meaning, also deeply appeals to me.

But I don't want just ink. I want **Symbols of Power** etched into my skin‚Äîreminders of who I am and who I'm becoming. They would be sigils of therapy, experience, insight, reading, integrating. Weapons and artifacts that offer strength: like armor, or a shield, like a sword, or a dagger, or the _Death Note_, or Narsil. Each depending on the occasion. Extra tools. Extra push.

### üó°Ô∏è Narsil ‚Äì the Sword that was Broken

![Narsil - the Sword that was Broken](narsil.src)

**Narsil**, for me, represents the permanent struggle of human will against evil. The sword that was broken and reforged, becoming even stronger than before. It's a reminder that our greatest strength often comes from our brokenness, from the pieces we've picked up and reassembled. When I feel shattered, I remember Narsil‚Äîhow it was reforged into And√∫ril, the Flame of the West, and became even more powerful than its original form.

### üõ°Ô∏è Master Sword ‚Äì the Blade of Evil's Bane

![Young Link pullling the Master Sword out of its pedestal](master_sword.src)

The Master Sword is iconic‚Äîa weapon that chooses its wielder, that tests their worthiness. It's not just about power, but about the heart and courage to wield it. The sword that seals the darkness, that stands as a beacon of hope. It represents the idea that true power comes with responsibility, that strength must be earned and maintained through constant vigilance and growth.
---

### üî´ MA5C Assault Rifle ‚Äì Halo's UNSC Standard

![Master Chief + MA5C = magical fireworks lol](ma5c.src)

The **MA5C** is my tool of precision‚Äîa weapon that represents human ingenuity and adaptability. In the face of overwhelming odds, it's the standard-issue rifle that helped humanity stand against the Covenant. It's a reminder that sometimes the most powerful tools are the ones we can rely on consistently, the ones we've mastered through practice and dedication.

### ‚ö° Mj√∂lnir ‚Äì Hammer of Thunder

![Mjolnir, as depicted in the God of War games](mjolnir.src)

**Mj√∂lnir** needs no explanation‚Äîit's the hammer that commands the storm, the weapon of the god of thunder. But beyond its raw power, it represents the weight of responsibility. Only the worthy can lift it, and those who do must bear the burden of its power. It's a reminder that true strength comes with great responsibility, and that power must be earned through character and action.
---

### üêâ Dragon Slayer ‚Äì Guts' Weapon of Suffering

![Guts from Berserk, wielding Dragon Slayer!](dragon_slayer.src)

**Dragon Slayer** is a sword made to kill dragons‚Äîa weapon so massive it was never meant to be wielded by a human. Yet Guts carries it, despite its weight, despite the pain. It's a symbol of perseverance, of carrying burdens that seem impossible, of transforming suffering into strength. The sword that was too big becomes the perfect weapon in the hands of someone who refuses to give up.
---

### üß≠ Vegvisir ‚Äì the Wayfinder Rune

![Vegvisir ‚Äì Icelandic magical stave](vegvisir.src)

The **Vegvisir** is an Icelandic magical stave‚Äîa compass that guides its bearer through rough weather. It's a symbol of navigation, of finding your way when the path is unclear. In a world of uncertainty, it represents the inner compass that guides us, the wisdom to find our way even when the storms of life rage around us.
---

### üåÄ "Amor fati" ‚Äì Phrase of Power

"**Amor fati**" means _love of fate_‚Äîa Stoic concept that teaches us to embrace everything that happens to us. It's not about passive acceptance, but about actively loving our fate, about finding meaning and growth in every experience. It's a reminder that our power lies not in controlling what happens to us, but in how we respond to it.
---

### üî¶ Lightsaber ‚Äì Weapon of Light, Shadow, and Will

![Lightsaber ‚Äì A blade tuned to the soul of its wielder](lightsaber.src)

The **lightsaber** is a weapon of will ‚Äî forged not just by Jedi in serene temples, but by Sith in rage-forged crucibles, and by rogue force wielders who walk between light and shadow. It's a symbol of **raw agency**, amplified by discipline, vision, or vengeance. The color of your blade says something... but never everything.

- **Blue and green**: guardians and seers ‚Äî clarity, peace, protection.
- **Red**: forged through pain ‚Äî will sharpened into fury, unapologetic power.
- **Purple**: the edge walker ‚Äî one who knows both peace and war.
- **White**: reclaimed sovereignty ‚Äî purified power.
- **Black (Darksaber)**: leadership through might and legend.

Use the lightsaber symbol when you must cut through confusion. When you're forging identity. When your truth needs to shine or strike. Whether you're aligning with the Force, bending it, or breaking from it altogether ‚Äî the saber is a reminder:

**You are the crystal. You decide how it burns.**

## üîÆ Final Notes for the Seeker

These are more than fandom. They're _tools_. Build your own **Codex of Symbols**. Make a wall, a tattoo sleeve, or an altar. Ritualize how and when you call on each power.

This is your inventory. Your magic. Your reminder:

**Power isn't just what you have ‚Äî it's what you remember.**
