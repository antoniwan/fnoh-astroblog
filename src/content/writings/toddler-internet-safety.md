## Our Digital Responsibility as Parents

In Puerto Rico—and across the world—we now raise children in an age where the Internet is everywhere. But **just because something is common, doesn't mean it's safe.**  
The Internet is NOT made for children. It's a wild field filled with beauty, but also with garbage, violence, extreme sexuality, and content a young child is not ready to handle.

> **A child's mind is like fertile soil. Whatever you plant now will either bloom—or rot—later.**
---

## 🛡️ Why do we need to protect kids from the Internet?

- **Children's developing brains** can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality like adults can.
- **Violent or sexual content** can cause trauma, anxiety, identity confusion, or even early addiction.
- **Algorithms have no compassion.** Their only goal is to keep your child watching.
- **Modern porn** is not educational or harmless. It's often grotesque, violent, and degrading.

## 🚨 What if I find out my child watched porn?

### Stay calm. Guilt doesn't help—love does.

#### For children under 6:

- **Do not scold.** They may not understand what they saw.
- Say something like:
  > Those images aren't for kids. If you ever see something that confuses or scares you, come tell me.

#### For children ages 6–12:

- Ask gently:

  > How did it feel to see that?" 
  > Did someone show it to you, or did it pop up by accident?

- Explain:
  > What you saw doesn't show real love. Our hearts and bodies deserve kindness and respect.

#### If the content was violent or humiliating:

- Seek professional help if needed.
- Reaffirm safety and connection daily.

## 🌱 Final Thought: Protect Now, Educate Always

What we teach a child in the early years is stronger than any algorithm.  
More than securing a device, we're **protecting a soul in formation**.

Do it with love. Do it with presence.  
Because **there is no app more powerful than a conscious parent.**
