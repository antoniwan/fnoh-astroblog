The practice of the practice of patience becomes a doorway to deeper understanding, not just of ourselves, but of the human condition itself.

Consider how the practice of patience shows up in your daily life. Perhaps it's in the way you interact with others, or in the moments when you're alone with your thoughts. Maybe it's in the choices you make, or in the way you respond to challenges and opportunities.
