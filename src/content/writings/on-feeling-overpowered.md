Note-to-self!

These days, I’m feeling OP (overpowered)! As I keep practicing the items below, my habits become even more consistent, and it’s easier to follow through with each. It feels like my brain is re-wiring, and it makes sense because my body and mind are changing, and it’s so evident. These are what work for me to feel healthy and genuinely overpowered.

I feel overpowered:

- After another completed workout, with entire focus, each set going until failure and without injuries.
- After another day without reaction, I only respond by controlling myself, not external influences or stimuli.
- I invest quality and conscious time with my children, with complete control and mental health. Every second I spend with them is growth.
- After every whole food meal that I prepare, cook, and enjoy, I make these meals with so much love and attention. My body thanks me through speed, strength, and health.
- Whenever I finish a book and feel the integration happening, the thoughts, the clarity, and a thousand more questions pop up. This curiosity is growth; I have learned more, and therefore, I have even more questions.
- Whenever I can identify that I’m procrastinating, I stop in my tracks and face the immobilization. Effective action is so empowering.
- After utilizing effective communication, I express myself with clarity and kindness.
- After I can go to bed early and sleep no less than 8 hours, up to 10 hours. What a luxury!

Whenever I invest space, compassion, time, and stillness, sometimes, the best investment for oneself is reading, writing, or doing nothing. Money is not the only thing you can invest in yourself! Listen to a music album. Or play video games. Or play the guitar. Or, again, to do nothing. Invest your time, attention, and energy into improving your life. After grooming up, taking care of my nails, hair, eyes, and hands, brushing and flossing, and maybe dressing up, even if I only have to go to the groceries.

After sharing with others some of my priviledge, without self-sacrificing. After being compassionate and kind with myself or others, perhaps by setting up a boundary or communicating my needs and wants clearly and without holding back.

After avoiding conflict by using kindness or resisting the urge to react violently and accept a tricky situation, restraint is incredible.

As life is so challenging, there s to feel overpowered. The most significant detail I’ve noticed is that quality input equals quality output in everything around and about our lives. Hard work, consistency, and drive pay off significantly. Delaying gratification works. All transformation and evolution have come from places of discomfort. Growth is uncomfortable and requires practice.

As usual, writing these made me aware of all my privileges regarding accessibility, time, money, and resources. Being grateful for these privileges is critical for becoming and staying healthy and kind. Every human being should have all of this, but it does not happen, and I’m aware and can identify this as unjust, but I must accept this, and whenever I can share my privilege, I pledge to do so, and I do. Without self-sacrificing because I am important and I love myself. I love you, but I love myself more, and that’s ok.
