I feel like there’s something special, something serene, about abstaining from carnal urges that do not align with our values or desisting from sexual impulses on the shallow end, kind of like abstaining from junk food or dishonesty. And to be clear, for me, it’s not a matter of right or wrong, good or bad, or better or worse. It’s about willpower, understanding oneself, applying restraint and integrity, delaying gratification, or abstaining from shallow or inane situations.

I’m aware this could very well be my past trauma manifesting and some process I have to go through myself, or perhaps some self-flagellation or self-sabotage. Maybe I’m just rationalizing some fears or emotions I’m not fully grasping or understanding about myself, specifically after my failures as a husband and in past romantic relationships. I don’t know yet, but I will find out.

### Does this resonate with some of you? What are your thoughts about this idea?

And to be extra precise, I do genuinely believe sexual intimacy or carnal desires are part of our natural life after all; it’s honest and essential for our lives and development as healthy human beings.
