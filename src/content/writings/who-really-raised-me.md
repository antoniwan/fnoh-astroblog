I've been thinking a lot about who raised me to be who I am. And I'm preparing an essay about that. _But this one is not about that._ This one is about the **fictional characters** that raised me.

<small>My daughter and I. Talking about magic fruit. Wink.</small>

When I think about what I value today, throughout my life, from childhood to now, I can only admit that fictional characters have influenced me heavily in my upbringing, my emotions, my feelings, and my paradigms. _It's absolutely insane!!! Jajaja_

I was able to identify many of the emotions tied to each. Here's how it goes!

## Here's my fictional character pantheon!!

🗡️ **Samurai X / Kenshin Himura** — The repentant warrior. **Strength in silence**. **Discipline forged through trauma**.

🔥 **Los Caballeros del Zodiaco** — **Brotherhood**. **Sacrifice**. **El Cosmo y el Universo como poder interno**. **Defender hasta la muerte**!! _We played this so much at school, holy shit!! We had a sand playground, so the sand was the water- went hard AF._

⚔️ **Piratas de las Aguas Negras** — **Rebellion**. **Magic**. **Lost history**. _Mystical maps for chosen warriors._

💪 **He-Man** — The quiet man who becomes the god of power _only when needed_. **Protector energy**. _Never liked his hair._

🐉 **Goku / DBZ** — **Relentless evolution**. **Joyful mastery**. **Purity**. **The warrior with a heart of gold**. _I stopped inviting people to spar years ago, close people still get asked sometimes (hi son! lol)._

🌒 **Ninja Scroll** — **Darkness, betrayal, honor**. **The lone blade that survives everything**.

🩸 **Berserk / Guts** — **Pain as power**. **Love through chaos**—_unstoppable resolve_. The eclipse arc broke me. _I ain't going to lie, I have to remind myself this is only fantasy._

🧠 **Dr. House** — **Logic + madness**. **Brutal truth-telling**. **Isolation as protection**. _nothing to see here…_

🧱 **Reacher** — **Power held in stillness**. **Silent justice**. **Unshakeable code**. _Dispatches bullies with elegance and proportional force_.

💀 **The Punisher** — **Vengeance + discipline**. _A protector that walks through fire unflinching. He HATES bullies!!! HE FUCKING HATES BULLIES! I dislike bullies._

🥋 **Daredevil** — **Blind faith, both literal and spiritual**. **Fighting with conscience**. _If he can do it, I can do it._

🦸 **Superman** — **Humility with godhood**. **The immigrant myth**. **The protector who never turns away**. _Imagine if he did NOT have a code, an immediate horror movie._

There's more. But these are the main ones.

Now that I'm older, the characters influencing or giving me **_joy_ are different.** Now that I'm older... the teachings don't hit the same — they go _deeper_. They don't just **inspire** — they _unfold me._

🌀 **My Hero Academia** — _Deku's trembling hands, still moving forward. All Might's fragile smile. Uraraka's silent bravery. The fire family arc broke me in half._ **What it means to carry trauma, keep going, and be worthy of your gift**.

⚔️ **Samurai Champloo** — Mugen and Jin: **the animal and the monk**. **The chaos and the code**. **The dance of masculine duality**. I've lived both. I do. _If you know me. You know._

🧠 **Evangelion** — **That psychological dread, the loneliness**. How can you be surrounded and still feel hollow? Shinji's scream sometimes lives in my chest. _The soundtrack…_

🩸 **Jujutsu Kaisen** — Gojo's radiant pain hidden behind power. **The bond between Yuji and Todo — true brotherhood forged in battle**. They SPAR. They grow. **_No ego. Just respect. That's sacred._**

🔥 **Demon Slayer** — **Total Concentration Breathing is my emotional regulation**. Literally. Tanjiro's fierce love… _that's how you protect your sister. That's how you protect your people._ Now I know. Thanks, Tanjiro, for literally showing me what nobody else had before. _Unbelievable_.

💥 **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** — **Be yourself, fully. Loudly. Stylishly. Own it. Earn your legacy with flair and grit**. _Power is personality. Your authenticity to YOU is your power._

👊 **Baki** — Okay, come on. Do I even need to say anything? **Discipline**. **Insanity**. **Combat as conversation**. _The gym is my dojo._

🕶️ **Afro Samurai** — **Cool is earned**. **Grief is sacred**. **Revenge is a weight**. The path is lonely, and beautiful, and _necessary_.

🦴 **Primal** — **No words. Just rawness. Loss. Survival. The bond of beings who see each other**. _I cried over a caveman and a dinosaur, man. Don't @ me._

🌑 **Berserk**, again — Because people _will_ betray you. And still, **you must protect your joy**. **You must carve your truth with a broken blade if you have to**.

### And last but not least…

<small>Sensei…</small>

🧢 **One Punch Man / Saitama** — **The loneliness of mastery**.

The absurdity of getting _everything_ you wanted… and feeling _nothing._ He won. He beat the game. He trained so hard that he went bald — _literally._ 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, 10 km run. Every. Day. I did this until it became so easy. I can do this now in minutes. **_Saitama gave me that!_** No AC. No excuses. No glory. No applause. Just effort. And now? He's a god wandering through mediocrity. _No challenge. No equal. No thrill._

Saitama isn't about winning. He's about **what happens after**. After winning... the beauty starts:

👦 **Genos** — His loyal disciple. Obsessed with revenge, fire, ambition. He thinks power = worth. But Saitama? He couldn't care less. He teaches Genos **restraint**, **humility**, and **presence**. Sometimes by accident. _Sometimes? LOL._ But **truths always leak out** from the still ones.

👊 **King** — The most powerful fraud. Everyone believes he's a god-tier fighter, but it's all a misunderstanding. He hides his cowardice behind a poker face. And yet Saitama? _Treats him like a friend. With no judgment. No agenda._ **_Boom_**. Because Saitama doesn't care about titles. He cares about the **energy**.

👽 **Boros** — The only one who made him use a _tiny bit_ of effort. A conqueror from the stars. A god in his own right. Boros dies smiling — not because he won — but because someone finally met him. **Saitama gave him the gift of a real fight**. That was mercy.

🐜 **Tatsumaki** — The psychic girl with attitude and trauma. Saitama just… _annoys_ her. But she can't shake him. He's immune to her drama. **That kind of emotional immovability? It heals, eventually**. She'll never say it, but she sees it. _Let's leave this here…_

🧠 **Mumen Rider** — The opposite of Saitama. No power. No chance. But infinite **heart**. _The real Saitama. The Real King. The real main character._ And Saitama **respects him**. DEEPLY. **_Because heart is what he's missing (Sensei!)_**

💀 **Garou** — The anti-hero. The broken boy who wants to become a monster. And Saitama? _He talks to him. No hate. My boy._ No revenge. Just listening. Just the truth. He offers him a mirror, not a fist. And that **saves** Garou.

🌀 **Fubuki** — She wants power. Influence. Control. But ends up hanging around Saitama because _he's the only man she can't manipulate. Sounds familiar? Sigh._

🎭 **The Hero Association** — Obsession with ranking, numbers, fame. Saitama quietly dismantles that whole system just by existing. He's proof that **none of it means anything**. And that makes them… uncomfortable.

🌌 **The Universe Itself** — Threat level: God. Still not ready. Because he hasn't lost _all_ his humanity yet. There's still boredom. There's still mild curiosity. There's still… his grocery runs.

**Saitama is not a joke. He's a lesson.** He's what happens when you **outgrow** everything. He's the **detached master**. The man with no desire. No fear. No rivals. Only _emptiness and sale items._ But even in that space, he remains gentle. Remains kind. Remains available. He reminds me…

- **To never forget joy.**
- **To never let success steal your wonder.**
- **To keep it real, even if the world misunderstands your power.**

And above all? **To keep showing up**. To the fight. To the friends. To the market on discount day. _LOL fuck off with that, Saitama Sensei, respectfully._ Because the meaning isn't in the victory — **It's in the living**.

I hope you enjoyed this. **_What's your jam? Who raised you?_**
