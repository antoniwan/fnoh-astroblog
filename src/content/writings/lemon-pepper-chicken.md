## 🥩 Ingredients:

- 6–12 **bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs**
- **Sea salt**, to taste
- **Fresh cracked black pepper**, heavy
- **1–2 lemons** (zest + juice)
- **1–2 tbsp raw honey**
- _(Optional)_: 1 garlic clove (minced), parsley, chili flakes, flaky salt
---

## 🛠️ Equipment:

- Wire rack
- Baking sheet
- Drip tray underneath (optional but recommended)
- Oven preheated to **350°F**
---

## 🔥 Instructions:

### 1. **Prep the Chicken**

- Towel-dry thighs thoroughly — especially the skin.
- Season both sides generously with **salt** and **cracked black pepper**.
- Zest lemon over the top (optional but adds citrus brightness).
- **Do NOT** add lemon juice before baking — it can cause bitterness.

### 2. **Arrange for Baking**

- Place thighs **skin side up** on a **wire rack** over a sheet pan.
- Place **cut lemons** in a separate dish beside the chicken to roast.

### 3. **Bake**

- Roast at **350°F** for **45 minutes**.
- Optionally rotate pan at minute 35 for even cooking.

### 4. **Broil for Finish**

- Broil on **high** for **2–3 minutes**, until the skin is crisp and bubbling.
- Watch closely to avoid burning.

### 5. **Rest and Glaze**

- Rest chicken for **5–10 minutes** after removing from oven.
- While hot, **brush raw honey** over the skin.
- **Squeeze the roasted lemons** over the chicken for bright acidity.
- _(Optional)_: Add extra pepper, flaky salt, or fresh parsley before serving.

## 💡 Tips & Variations:

- For sweet heat: add chili flakes to honey.

- Serve with: roasted potatoes, couscous, broccolini, or arugula salad.

## 📦 Meal Prep Notes:
