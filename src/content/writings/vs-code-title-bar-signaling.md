## 🎯 PURPOSE

Modern developers multitask across systems, moods, and levels of importance. This system allows you to:

- Immediately recognize where your focus is.
- Visually separate critical systems from creative zones.
- Avoid context-switch fatigue.
- Bring emotional intelligence into your toolchain.

By using title bar colors in VS Code as visual metaphors, we reinforce intentionality.

## 🛠️ HOW IT WORKS

Each project folder can contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a unique title bar color:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "titleBar.activeBackground": "#006400",
    "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "#004d00",
    "titleBar.activeForeground": "#ffffff"
  }
}
```

This is per-project and auto-applies when opening that folder in VS Code.

## 🔢 TITLE BAR LEVELS

| Level       | Color Hex         | Purpose                                |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | #8B0000 / #5A0000 | Production systems, finance, legal ops |
| 🟠 WORK     | #FF8C00 / #CC7000 | Focused development, job-related work  |
| 🟡 SUPPORT  | #CCCC00 / #999900 | Utility tools, backups, API clients    |
| 🟢 FUN      | #006400 / #004d00 | Creative and joyful projects           |
| 🔵 LEARNING | #1E90FF / #0B73D9 | Tutorials, sandbox, experimentation    |
| 🟣 PERSONAL | #8A2BE2 / #6A1BA2 | Writing, rituals, personal growth      |

## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Decide project intent (e.g. FUN, CRITICAL, WORK).
2. Copy matching template to your project:
   cp ~/Developer/templates/vscode-green.json ~/Developer/projects/my-project/.vscode/settings.json
3. Open the folder in VS Code — it will apply automatically.
