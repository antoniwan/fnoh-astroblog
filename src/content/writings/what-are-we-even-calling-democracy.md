They keep calling it democracy.

But I don't know what that means anymore.

You vote. Maybe.
Someone wins. Nothing changes.

The faces shift.
The suits smile.
The decisions? Already made.
Before you ever showed up.

They say, "Be patient."
But for what?
We're watching billionaires write laws.
Watching cops crush dissent with gear we paid for.
Watching kids work to feed their families while Congress argues about lunch.

Is that democracy?
Is democracy when your choices are two flavors of the same shit?
Red lies. Blue lies.
Same donors. Same bombs.
Same silence when it matters.

Maybe it's democracy if you squint hard enough.
Or maybe it's just a polite word for controlled collapse.
Maybe democracy isn't a system anymore — just a costume.
Worn by dying empires to keep the lights on a little longer.

Still, I want to believe.
Not in what we have — but in what could be.
In something people actually shape.
Where leaders don't rule, they serve.
Where truth matters more than spin.
Where voting is one small part, not the whole damn ritual.

But we're not there.
Not yet.
And maybe not ever —
Unless we stop pretending what we have is good enough.
