In our fast-paced world, waiting has become something to avoid at all costs. We fill every moment with distractions, notifications, and busyness. But what if waiting itself could be a practice of becoming more human?

The ancient practice of mindful waiting teaches us that the space between moments is not empty—it's pregnant with possibility. When we learn to wait with awareness, we discover that patience is not passive resignation but active presence.

Consider the way a seed waits in the soil. It doesn't rush its transformation, nor does it resist the process. It simply waits, gathering the nutrients it needs, responding to the rhythms of earth and sky. In this waiting, it becomes something entirely new.

Human waiting works the same way. When we wait mindfully, we're not just killing time—we're allowing time to work on us. We're giving space for our thoughts to settle, our emotions to clarify, and our intentions to crystallize.

The next time you find yourself waiting—in line, in traffic, for news, for change—try this simple practice: take three deep breaths and ask yourself, "What is this moment trying to teach me?" You might be surprised by what emerges in the space of patient attention.
