I used to require recipes whenever I cooked anything. About 16 years later, now that I understand some of the cooking components (heating, cooling, ingredients, some techniques, instruments, knife work, the recipes themselves) at a basic but proficient level, I can cook without recipes and create my tasty recipes and fusions.

It’s funny how that works and applies to almost anything in life.

Foundational knowledge and experiences change everything else on top of that foundation.
