Sometimes, I wonder how I can be so content and at peace while possessing so little. Am I so broken that I conform to whatever happens to me? _I feel lost AF, only momentarily…_

I close my eyes and immediately evoke _clarity_.<br>I hear nothing.<br>I’m safe and at peace.<br>My thoughts are nurturing, calm, uplifting. I can focus and bring up some of my troubles and problems, but they’re just challenges — gifts for growth — and I’m eager to work on them.

Sometimes, I’m blocked from progressing — waiting for something else, like a piece of mail to arrive — and I’m unable to act. That’s fine. That’s _great_, actually. Other issues, like lowering my debts or being able to spend more time with my daughter, are solved with patience. If I do nothing — if I desist from going out, eating out, buying this or that — I’ll be fine. I’ll meet my financial goals.

I can call my daughter when she leaves school. In the long term, I’ll have her over the holidays. Patience and temperance are the solution.

I need to do nothing. This is great.

My body is calm, lying unbothered in my bed. Nothing hurts. My health is with me. I invest heavily in being strong and healthy — in time, effort, food, and sleep. I eat whole foods — limiting my diet in ways that seem obvious now. I work out five times a week, which keeps me busy, sharp, and disciplined. here’s my current split: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11S6WNhmZTlMaxH4dRJlkqQpLG4716bP-T4Qs3wSmFUc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11S6WNhmZTlMaxH4dRJlkqQpLG4716bP-T4Qs3wSmFUc/edit?usp=sharing).

I’ve learned to do hard things. I possess so few material objects, but I possess so much strength, agility, discipline, temperance, and willpower. I play basketball, box, do martial arts, or dance at least twice a week — keeping me young at heart, playful, competitive. My daughter loves our dance parties; we can dance for hours.

I reassess:

> Do I possess so little?

Maybe materially, yes. But in every other way —  I’m rich.

I have so many tools. So much privilege in my experiences. I use mental abstractions to harness willpower, transmute anger, channel discomfort into growth. Sometimes, I just rest and chill — *guilt-free*.

> Am I broken because I need so little?

Or is our world broken for making us believe we need so much more than the basics — good food, good company, hugs, friendships, hobbies, time off, time to do nothing, time to learn shit that matters?

I wonder if I’m broken because I don’t want to conquer the world. Or maybe… maybe I _am_ conquering my world. And that’s OK.

I’m confused momentarily. Then it hits me like a truck: Comparing myself to the so-called conquerors of the world was fucking up my perspective. Maybe comparison itself is one of our biggest diseases.

I don’t know for sure. But I stopped comparing myself to them — and just returned to my peaceful, content state. Rich. Whole. Enough.

But… am I whole?

I’m 37 years old. Single.<br>I don’t feel like I need a girlfriend or a partner.<br>Is that OK?<br>Am I broken?<br>Am I abnormal?<br>What the fuck is wrong with me?<br>Everybody needs sex, right? Everybody needs a partner, right?

I don’t know.<br>I’m so at peace.<br>I don’t watch porn.<br>My occasional solo sessions feel deep and fulfilling — mind-muscle connections, lol.<br>Is that weird? Maybe. But it feels good.<br>Being alone feels good.

Hmmmm…

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. But it feels so natural. So right. I’m so content. I’ll probably fall asleep right here where I’m sitting.

Being stress-free is intoxicating. I’m high on peace.

Maybe I’m not broken at all. Maybe the world needs a few more broken ones like me — People who choose peace, patience, and simplicity over chaos.

Maybe the real brokenness is thinking we ever needed more than this:

- A clear mind.
- A heart at rest.
- A soul willing to dance.

I smile. I breathe. I feel the air on my skin and the quiet beating of my heart. I realize: I’m not missing anything. I am — right now — complete.
